# Bunny Eats Carrots

This is my bunny eats carrots project. Given an array representing
a garden with patches of carrots you can watch the bunny eat the
path with the greatest number of carrots.

## Usage

Within the root dir run:

> > ruby start.rb

If you want to run a different garden layout, you can add or edit
existing layouts in the start.rb file.
